I am a dedicated PhD candidate in Electronic Information Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. My research focuses on the crossroads of deep learning and brain science, where I use PyTorch to build neural networks and explore the interpretability of Transformer models, especially ViT.

In addition to my research, I have received several prestigious awards at both the national and international levels, including the 3rd prize in the China College Students' 'Internet+' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition and Honorable Mention in the American College Students' Mathematical Contest in Modeling.

I am passionate about advancing the field of artificial intelligence and am excited to contribute to innovative research in the embedded systems and communications domain.
